                        Fish and chips is the quintessential British dish served with fried battered fish and deep-fried potatoes.
                        Fried battered fish originated from Spanish and Portuguese Jews who prepared fish which was coated with flour
                        and fried in oil as a meal for days of religious observance on which cooking was prohibited. The concept of
                        serving fried fish served with chips started with the opening of the first fish and chip shop in London's
                        East End and the popularity of the dish spread across the United Kingdom. Today, the dish is often regarded
                        as the national dish of the United Kingdom.

                        <li>
                            Peel and slice 4 large potatoes into strips. Place sliced potato strips in a bowl with cold water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add 1 cup of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper
                            into a separate bowl and mix them together. 
                        </li>

                            Add 1 cup of milk and an egg. Stir until the batter is smooth and let the batter rest for 20 minutes.
