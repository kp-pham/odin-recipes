                        The English Breakfast is the traditional breakfast dish served with sausages, bacon, and fried eggs with mushrooms, baked beans,
                        and grilled tomatoes on the side. The English Breakfast is also known as the <strong>full breakfast</strong> which was popularized
                        during the Victorian Era when cookbooks promoted recipes for larged cooked breakfasts typically enjoyed by the upper class for the
                        middle class. The English Breakfast became a staple of the middle class throughout Britain and Ireland and remains a popular 
                        traditional breakfast served in pubs as an all-day breakfast meal.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Place the beans in a small saucespan and heat the sauce pan to medium-low. Add ketchup and HP sauce over the beans and heat
                            the beans for around 5 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Heat the skillet to medium and place 3 slices of bacon and 2 sausages. Heat the bacon sausages for around 10 minutes until
                            the sausages are browned and the bacon is cooked to your taste. Remove the bacon and sausages from the skillet and place
                            them to the side. Leave the bacon fat in the skillet for later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place the cherry tomatoes and mushrooms in the skillet and sear them in the bacon fat for around 2 minutes. Remove the cherry
                            tomatoes and mushrooms from the skillet when done.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add 1 cup of water to the saucepan. Crack 2 large eggs and cook them in medium-low heat until the whites are set but the yolks
                            are still runny. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Plate the sausages, slices of bacon, and eggs on the right side of the plate and the baked beans, tomatoes, and mushrooms on
                            the left side of the plate.
