        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Bangers and mash is a traditional British dish served with sausages and mashed potatoes topped with onion gravy.
            The term <em>banger</em> originated from food rationing during World War 1 when sausages were produced with high
            water content and prone to explode when heated. Bangers and mash remains a staple of British cuisine as a comfort
            food that can be enjoyed at the pub or in the comfort of your own home.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium-sized onions</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon of sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cup of water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of milk</li>
            <li>5 beef sausages</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of mashed potatoes mix</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set the stove to medium-high heat. Fry the sausages for between 4-5 minutes and then set them off to the side.
                Save the leftover sausage grease in the pan for later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Procure two medium-sized onions for chopping and slicing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adjust the stove to low heat. Add the onions onto the pan with the sausage grease and continuously stir the pan
                until there is a gentle sizzle. Add 1 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and leave the pan off to the side once the onions
                have been cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 1/3 cup of water into a separate stove. Boil the water.
                Add 1/3 cup of milk and pour in 1 1/2 cups of mashed potatoes mix. Stir gently with a fork until the mashed
                potatoes mix are soft and moist.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a teaspoon of butter onto the onions. Pour in the gravy and stir for around 3 minutes until the water boils.
                Add additional seasoning if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put sausages into the gravy to finish cooking. Let the sausages simmeri n low heat for around 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plate the sausages on top of the mashed potatoes and pour the gravy over the sausages and mashed potatoes.
            </li>
